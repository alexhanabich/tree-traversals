# tree-traversals
Implemented 4 different ways to traverse a binary tree, inorder, preorder, postorder and levelorder.  
Inorder, preorder and postorder traversals use a variaton of DFS
levelorder uses a variation of BFS.  

treenode.py defines TreeNode datatype and includes functions that converts lists to binary tree
